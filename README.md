PM2.5, fine particulate matter, smaller than 2.5 micrometers, also known as particle pollution.  A great risk to the health of the planet and all life on it. Once a particle is inside the body, it is very hard to expel and may get trapped in the lungs or bloodstream. Knowing the causes of this deadly pollution can help to decrease the source and the publics exposure. 

Three regression models are attached to help solve this problem. Multiple linear regression, ridge regression and random forest regression are used and compared to find the best model and see how PM2.5 depends on other air pollutants and meteorological effects.
