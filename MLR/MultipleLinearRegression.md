# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis
Multiple linear regression is used to predict a dependent variable based on multiple independent variable. It is used to identify how the dependent variable changes when the independent variables change. Multiple linear regression follows the formula   
$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + ... $$

where y is the dependent variable, $\beta_0 $ is the y-intercept, when all independent variables are zero, $\beta_1 , \beta_2 , \beta_3$, ... are the regression coefficients when there is a change in the independent variable while all other variables are held constant, $x_, x_2,x_3$,... are the independent variables.
